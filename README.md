Here is my Detoxify Backend Git Repo 

A Node.js + Express backend that powers the Detoxify app: a video filtering and feed service that reads user-selected categories, applies filters, and serves filtered video content. Built with OAuth-based auth (Google), persistent session handling, and a MongoDB database.
Current stack: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), Passport / OAuth2 (Google), JWT (optional), plus helpful dev tools (nodemon, dotenv).
